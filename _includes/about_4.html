                        Software doesn't live in its own bubble. It exists to serve the needs of the
                        particular organization for which it was written. It was created to solve business
                        problems, address organizational challenges, automate error-prone processes, create
                        new opportunities and make things happen faster, simpler. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        In Pragmatic Software SMPC, we firmly believe that our solutions can only be evaluated
                        in terms of the success of their practical application. It is not enough for it "to work".
